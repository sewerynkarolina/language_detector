The variations of the applied bending moment with the applied axial load for fully elastic, elasticplastic and fully plastic conditions are derived. The ultimate goal of such simulation technique is to develop a simple and fast technique to determine stresses, strains, springback and residual stresses as functions of parameters such as material characteristics, forming loads and the required geometry of Usection beams. The model proposed in the present study can be considered as a major step for computer simulation of stretehbending at the design stage which will provide useful data and criteria for equipment selection and tooling design. The significance of various material parameters from productibility, ease of fabrication and tool design viewpoints can also be evaluated by the model.

Sidrak Department of Chemical Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia (ylsidrak~lpc.kfupm.edu.sa) (Received September 1996; in final form June 1997) Abstract: The bulk of the red mud residue, a byproduct of the Bayer process used to produce alumina from bauxite ores, is separated from the desanded slurry in a set of thickeners before pumping the turbid liquor to security filtration. This paper addresses the problem of maintaining a constant mud level in a network of thickeners tanks, a high underflow mud density and a low overflow turbidity, by regulatory and adaptive feedforward control of underflow pump(s) speed. This ensures stabilization of the thickeners operation, improvement of the red mud washing efficiency in the washing operation, and smoother security filtration. The development of the control algorithm is outlined. The evaluation of the closedloop performance of the controlled plant has been carried out using both computer simulation and manual testing in a central control room. The results have shown that the automatic control algorithm has performed as expected in the control of thickener mud level. However, as expected, the infrequent sampling of the feed, underflow density and mud level in the thickener has introduced some errors into the control system, a result which reinforces the need for automatic mud level sensors.

Shazali Department of Civil Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia AbstractThe development and details of the computer code HLXVIB are presented as a viable means to assess the dynamic structural response of prismatic circular helicoidal bars. To this end, the development of the dynamic transport (transfer) matrix T f$ is first outlined for a typical helicoidal segment. Then, the implementation of the resulting matrix in the program HLXVIB is discussed to emphasize particular attractive features of the program. Several parametric studies are presented to illustrate the application of the program to studying the vibration characteristics of circular helicoidal bars as type of the more general class of threedimensional bars. Copyright 0 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd. INTRODUCTION As one particular type of the more general three dimensional structural bars, circular helicoidal bars possess certain geometrical characteristics which render them amenable to analytical investigations to assess their structural response under a general state of loading. It is well known by structural analysts that matrix tools of space structural analysis require a well defined structural geometry. It is also well established that the results of a typical structural analysis and the of the results are largely dependent on the format used to describe the geometry of a given structure. One would, therefore, expect the process of structural analysis and the interpretation of the results to be quite easy when a simple description of geometry is emphasized.

The numerical part of the study wascam’ed out using: (i) the com- puter model which accounts for the actual propertiesof thecompositeconstituentsdeveloped aspart of thisstudy,(ii) theACI load-deflection model, and (iii) the modified load-deflection model availablein the literaturefor beams rein- forced by FRP bars.

In this paper, a survey was conducted to study the relationship between attitudes and computer utilization of 238 students. The article also examined whether or not computer utilization was affected by some demographic (e.g., age) and other non attitudinal variables. The findings indicated that the overall attitude did affect computer utilization. The part of attitude scale that presented the strongest predictor of utilization was computer liking followed by confidence. Anxiety and perceived usefulness were found to be insignificant determinants of computer utilization. In addition to attitude, other variables appeared to have a strong influence on computer utilization, namely the degree of computer experience, the degree of access to computers, and the number of computerrelated courses taken by surveyparticipants. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd Keywords computer attitudes, computer attitude scale, computer anxiety, computer confidence, computer liking, computer usefulness, computer utiliza tion Requests for reprints should be addressed to Dr M.

Finding an optimal and complete test suite that can be used in the testing process is often an exhaustive task. Various methods have been proposed for the generation of compiler test cases. Many papers have been published on testing compilers, most of which address classical programming languages. In this paper, we assess and compare various compiler testing techniques with respect to some selected criteria and also propose some new research directions in compiler testing of modem programming languages. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. Keywords: Compiler; Test case generation; Software testing; Test suite Testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors. Testing cannot prove the absence of errors in a software program unless it is exhaustive. If for some test data the software behaves\n",

ELSHARKAWYt§ (Received 1 July 1996; in final form 13 January 1997) AbstraetA complel~e analysis for stretehbending of Usection beams is introduced. The variations of the applied bending moment with the applied axial load for fully elastic, elasticplastic and fully plastic conditions are derived. The ultimate goal of such simulation technique is to develop a simple and fast technique to determine stresses, strains, springback and residual stresses as functions of parameters such as material characteristics, forming loads and the required geometry of Usection beams. The model proposed in the present study can be considered as a major step for computer simulation of stretehbending at the design stage which will provide useful data and criteria for equipment selection and tooling design. The significance of various material parameters from productibility, ease of fabrication and tool design viewpoints can also be evaluated by the model. Furthermore, l~he failure modes of the stretchbending process are also introduced and the region for safe operations are defined in a very useful and practical set of curves. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd A B b t d E h M N N, Me Ne m nr nrf K,n R Re R, 8p y try ey ,/ ot /J 0 Iz NOMENCLATURE area of the crosssection of the beam width of the flange of the beam width of the web of the beam thickness of the flange of the beam distance between the centerline and the neutral axis Young's modulus height of the beam bending moment axial tensile force axial tensile force considering friction effect maximum elastic bending moment, Eqn (9) maximum elastic tensile force, Eqn (8) nondimensional bending moment, MIMe nondimensional axial force, NINe nondimensional axial force considering fri\n",
